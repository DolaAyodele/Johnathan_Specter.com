                <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business. <br> <br>
                I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>

                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself. <br><br>
                    A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean. <br><br>
                    <q>How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?</q> <br>
                    You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about. <br><br>
                    I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
